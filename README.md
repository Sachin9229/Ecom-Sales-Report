# Ecom-Sales-Report
In Ecom Sales Data project, I embarked on an extensive data analytics venture, concentrating on e-commerce sales data. My approach involved sourcing data from platforms like Kaggle and employing Excel for in-depth data analysis. I utilized Power BI for dynamic data visualization and applied exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to extract valuable insights, particularly for optimizing pricing strategies and augmenting business analysis. The culmination of my project was the creation of interactive Power BI dashboards, showcasing my ability to seamlessly integrate data handling, analysis, and presentation, thereby delivering a comprehensive end-to-end data analysis solution.
